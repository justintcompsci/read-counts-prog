# read-counts-prog
Write a C++ program that reads a file and counts the number of alphabetic characters, number of uppercase letters, 
number of punctuation characters, and the number of whitespace characters in the file. You must utilize the get function 
to process the file one character at a time. The data file to use is the Gettysburg Address, which is found below. 
Your program should utilize the cctype functions found here and on pages 548-553 in your textbook. The authorâ€™s explanation is very good. 
The program should produce a report containing the above information.
